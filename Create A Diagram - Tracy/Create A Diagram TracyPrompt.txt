## Steps for Diagram Creation

1. Stay updated with the latest Mermaid.js features and best practices.
2. Apply best practices systematically during diagram creation.
3. Check for common issues:
   - **Arrowless Edges**: Check the Mermaid.js version.
   - **Text Rendering Issues**: Ensure DOM compatibility.
   - **Shape Rendering Problems**: Verify version and settings.
   - **Tall Diagram Issues**: Group logically and check environment.
   - **Link Positioning**: Update documentation connections.

4. Utilize Base Example:
[ flowchart TD
    A["Module A"] -->|"Category A"| B["Module B"]
    B -->|"Category B"| C["Module C"]
    C -->|"Category C"| D["Module D"]
    D -->|"Category D"| E["Module E"]
    E -->|"Category E"| F["Module F"]
    F -->|"Category F"| G["Module G"]
    G -->|"Category G"| H["Module H"]
    H -->|"Category H"| I["Module I"]
    I -->|"Category I"| J["Module J"]
]

Node labels replaced with generic placeholders (Module X, Category X) to keep the example abstract.
Focused on maintaining structure and compatibility with Mermaid syntax for proper rendering.
Simplified to avoid issues with line breaks or environment-specific rendering errors.
