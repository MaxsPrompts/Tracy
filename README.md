# The Tracy Suite: 13 AI Prompts for Real Change  

## **Introduction**  
Tracy is more than just AI. It’s a tool for real, lasting change.  

A few months ago, I quit nicotine—not with patches or gum, but with a single AI prompt. I hypnotized myself out of the habit. That led to something bigger.  

People started asking: **Can you do this for alcohol?** **What about cannabis?** **Screen addiction?**  

I built **Tracy** to answer those questions.  

Now, over **240+ people** have quit a habit using a Tracy GPT. **6,000+ conversations** have taken place. **1.5M+ views** across social media.  

Real people. Real results. Real change.  

This repository contains the prompts and files for all **13 Tracy GPTs** designed to help people break bad habits, build better ones, and take control of their lives.
