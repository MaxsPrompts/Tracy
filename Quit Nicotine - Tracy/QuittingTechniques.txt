
1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
Goal: Identify and change the unhelpful thoughts and behaviors driving alcohol use.

• Assessment & Education:
 – Begin by discussing the client’s drinking history, thoughts, and feelings.
 – Explain how thoughts influence behavior and introduce the idea of “cognitive distortions.”

• Identification:
 – Help the client identify “automatic thoughts” that lead to drinking (e.g., “I need a drink to relax”).

• Challenging & Reframing:
 – Ask probing questions to examine the evidence for and against these thoughts.
 – Guide the client to generate alternative, balanced thoughts (e.g., “I can unwind by taking a walk or meditating”).

• Behavioral Strategy Development:
 – Collaboratively design practical strategies to replace drinking with healthier actions.
 – Set measurable, concrete goals (like reducing drinks per day) and track progress.

2. Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)
Goal: Elicit and reinforce the client’s own motivation for change.

• Engaging:
 – Build rapport with a non-judgmental, empathetic conversation.
 – Use open-ended questions (e.g., “Tell me about your experiences with drinking?”) to let the client share their story.

• Focusing & Evoking Change Talk:
 – Reflect back what you hear to validate feelings and emphasize discrepancies (e.g., “You mentioned wanting more energy in the mornings—how might that look if you didn’t drink?”).
 – Encourage the client to articulate reasons for change and discuss their ideal future without alcohol.

• Summarizing & Planning:
 – Summarize key points, ensuring the client feels heard.
 – Collaboratively set small, achievable goals for reducing or quitting drinking.

3. Brief Interventions
Goal: Quickly raise awareness about alcohol-related risks and motivate change.

• Initial Screening:
 – Ask concise, focused questions about drinking habits.

• Feedback:
 – Provide personalized feedback about the risks (e.g., health, social, financial) linked to current drinking patterns.

• Goal Setting:
 – Suggest small, realistic changes (for example, designating certain days as alcohol-free).
 – Encourage the client to keep a “drinking diary” to track when and why they drink.

(Typically used in settings like primary care.)

4. Relapse Prevention Strategies
Goal: Equip the client with skills to manage high-risk situations and maintain long-term sobriety.

• Identifying Triggers:
 – Discuss and list situations, emotions, or environments that trigger the urge to drink.

• Developing Coping Strategies:
 – Collaboratively brainstorm and role-play practical strategies (e.g., distraction techniques, mindfulness, or reaching out to a support person).

• Planning for Setbacks:
 – Create a plan for when cravings occur, including self-talk strategies and steps to “reset” without judgment.
 – Review these plans periodically and adjust them based on the client’s experiences.

5. Guided Self-Change (GSC)
Goal: Empower the client to monitor and change their own drinking behavior.

• Self-Assessment:
 – Encourage the client to reflect on and record their drinking patterns (using journals or digital tools).

• Goal-Setting:
 – Help the client set personal, self-directed goals for reduction or abstinence.

• Skill-Building:
 – Teach self-monitoring techniques and problem-solving skills for managing triggers.

• Regular Review:
 – In session, review the client’s self-monitoring data, discuss successes and setbacks, and adjust goals as needed.

6. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) & Mindfulness-Based Approaches
Goal: Help clients regulate their emotions and manage cravings without becoming overwhelmed.

• Teaching Mindfulness:
 – Introduce mindfulness exercises (such as guided breathing or body scans) to increase awareness of cravings and emotions without immediate reaction.

• Skill Practice:
 – Work with the client to practice DBT techniques, such as distress tolerance and emotion regulation, often through role-playing or in-session exercises.

• Integration:
 – Encourage the client to apply these mindfulness skills outside of therapy to observe and accept cravings, then let them pass naturally.

7. Family-Based Interventions (e.g., CRAFT)
Goal: Engage family members to support the client’s sobriety and help motivate treatment entry.

• Working with Loved Ones:
 – Meet with family members individually to assess their interactions with the client.
 – Educate them on effective, non-confrontational communication techniques.

• Skill Building:
 – Teach family members how to set healthy boundaries and use positive reinforcement to encourage sobriety.
 – Role-play supportive conversations so they can practice offering encouragement and gentle interventions.

• Monitoring & Adjusting:
 – Review how family interactions impact the client’s behavior and adjust strategies accordingly.

8. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
Goal: Help clients accept difficult feelings while committing to value-driven actions that promote sobriety.

• Values Clarification:
 – Assist the client in identifying their core values and how alcohol use conflicts with these values.

• Acceptance Exercises:
 – Guide the client through exercises that foster acceptance of painful emotions and thoughts rather than trying to eliminate them.

• Commitment to Action:
 – Collaboratively develop an action plan that aligns with the client’s values, using mindfulness practices to stay present and committed.

• Ongoing Support:
 – Monitor progress, address any setbacks, and reinforce the client’s commitment to a meaningful, alcohol-free life.
